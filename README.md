# My Weather Dashboard

My Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather conditions of any city. It presents current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for the searched city. The searched city is also added to a search history list, allowing users to revisit the weather conditions of previously searched cities.

## Features

- Search for weather conditions of any city
- Present current weather conditions (city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed)
- Present a 5-day forecast (date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity)
- Add searched cities to a search history list
- Click on a city in the search history to see its current and future conditions again

## Installation and Usage

To use the My Weather Dashboard, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the "Search" button. The current and future weather conditions for the searched city will be displayed, and the city will be added to the search history list. To see the weather conditions of a previously searched city, click on the city in the search history list.
